# Question 1
# Suppose we have 7 disjoint datasets and each dataset contains 12 data entries. How many data entries do we have in total?

no_of_datasets = 7
no_of_entries_in_each_dataset = 12

# How many entries in total
# Using rule of product,

total_entries = no_of_datasets * no_of_entries_in_each_dataset
print(total_entries) # 84

# What is the number of segments in the picture below? Each segment joins two circles.

upper_segment_node = 6
lower_segment_node = 7

total_segments = upper_segment_node * lower_segment_node
print(total_segments) # 42
